Included in the submission:
hellomodules - some test modules i made to practice making kernels, based on examples off the website.
my_printk practice - practicing and playing around with the my_printk provided by Rich.
keyboard_module - Attempt at making an interrupt driven keyboard module.

Interrupt driven keyboard module. 
To run: 
make
./keyboard_module_test

Limitations:

Code will currently always seg fault. This is because I can't check 0x64 for a key press so it just
grabs whatever is in 0x60 which for some reason is always saying a key is being pressed/released.
This is seen by looking at the kernel log ($ dmesg). I couldn't figure out how to fix it and stop it
from always detecting keys being pressed.

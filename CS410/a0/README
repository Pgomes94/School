To run, run the following commands:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./
make 

to test the programs run:
./getsections objsect.o
./getsyms objsect.o
./getsections_dl objsect.o RTLD_LAZY
./getsections_dl objsect.o RTLD_NOW
./getsyms_dl objsect.o RTLD_LAZY
./getsyms_dl objsect.o RTLD_NOW

This will write all the stats (with headers for each call) into stats, view with:
cat stats
NOTE: sorry for all the extra zeroes at the start of the actual numbers, was having trouble implementing it a different way due to troubles with the strlen() function (possibly broken on csa2?...)

to clean out all generated files (except the stats file which should be manually removed with rm stats) run:
make clean

Stats file created on linux machine Duey in the CS undergrad lab.
